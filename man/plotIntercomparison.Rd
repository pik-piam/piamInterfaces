\arguments{
\item{mifFile}{path to the mif or xlsx file to apply summation checks to, or quitte object}

\item{outputDirectory}{path to directory to place one PDF for each model and scenario}

\item{summationsFile}{in inst/summations folder that describes the required summation groups}

\item{renameModels}{vector with oldname = newname}

\item{lineplotVariables}{vector with variable names for additional lineplots or filenames
of files containing a 'Variable' column (or both)}

\item{interactive}{boolean whether you want to select variables, regions and models to be plotted}

\item{mainReg}{region name of main region to be passed to mip}

\item{plotby}{whether you would like to have everything plotted by scenario, model and/or onefile}

\item{diffto}{if specified, the difference to this scenario is calculated and plotted}
