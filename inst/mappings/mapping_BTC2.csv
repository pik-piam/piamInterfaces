Terrestrial Biodiversity|Biodiversity Intactness Index;%;2;Terrestrial biodiversity measured with Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII);The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) summarises the change in ecological communities in response to human pressures. The BII is an estimated percentage of the original number of species that remain and their abundance in any given area, despite human impacts. The main difference between MSA and BII is that every unit of land is given equal weight in MSA, whereas BII gives more weight to species-rich areas.;Biodiversity|BII;unitless;100;additional mapping taken from additional_NAVIGATE, additional_NAVIGATE category: SDG;M;

Terrestrial Biodiversity|Mean Species Abundance;%;3;Terrestrial biodiversity measured in Mean Species Abundance (MSA);An indicator of naturalness or biodiversity intactness. It is defined as the mean abundance of original species relative to their abundance in undisturbed ecosystems. An MSA (Mean Species Abundance) of 0 % means a completely destructed ecosystem, with no original species remaining. An MSA of 100 % indicates an undisturbed ecosystem, in which species abundance is comparable to the natural state.;;;;;;
